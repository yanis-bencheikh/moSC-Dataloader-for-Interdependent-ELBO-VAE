## **README: Available Datasets and Functional DataLoaders**

---

### **Introduction**
This project involves processing and analyzing multi-modal single-cell datasets to enable advanced machine learning applications. Currently, we have datasets related to **RNA sequencing (GEX)**, **chromatin accessibility sequencing (ATAC-seq)**, and **CITE-seq** (simultaneous RNA and protein profiling). These datasets are designed to facilitate predictions, alignments, and representations of cellular states. Each dataset is integrated with custom-built DataLoaders to allow seamless interaction with PyTorch models.

### **3. Task Design**

#### **Predictive Modeling with ATAC-seq**
- **Goal**: Reconstruct denoised chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC-seq peaks) from raw counts using convolutional encoders.
- **Relevance**:
  - Chromatin accessibility profiles are inherently structured by genomic loci, making convolutional neural networks (CNNs) a natural choice for feature extraction and pattern detection.
  - Convolutions can effectively model both local and long-range dependencies by using dilated convolutions or wide kernels.
- **Applications**:
  - **Feature Interpretation**: Identify patterns in chromatin accessibility associated with transcription factor binding or regulatory elements.
  - **Denoising**: Predict clean, normalized peak accessibility profiles for downstream analyses.
  - **Latent Representation**: Learn biologically meaningful embeddings of chromatin states for clustering or trajectory inference.

#### **Alignment Tasks**
- **Goal**: Align chromatin profiles across batches, donors, or experimental conditions.
- **Applications**:
  - Normalize chromatin accessibility data while preserving biological signal.
  - Compare regulatory landscapes across cell types or conditions.

#### **Latent Representation Learning**
- **Goal**: Extract shared embeddings for chromatin profiles that capture regulatory activity across genomic regions.
- **Applications**:
  - Integrate ATAC-seq data with RNA-seq or other modalities.
  - Infer transcription factor activity and gene regulatory networks.

### **4. Key Considerations**
- **Challenges**:
  - Chromatin accessibility data is highly sparse and high-dimensional, requiring robust encoders like CNNs to capture meaningful signals.
  - Long-range regulatory dependencies necessitate models capable of expanding receptive fields, such as dilated or multi-scale convolutions.
- **Approach**:
  - Use **convolutional encoders** with dilated convolutions to balance local feature extraction and global context.
  - Incorporate pooling or attention mechanisms to reduce dimensionality without losing important biological signals.
